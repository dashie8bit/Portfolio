  <head>Wow, it's so high up here!</head>
  <body><p>Huh. This is a paragraph. Lots of space up here!</p></body>

  <h6>heh. That rhymes.</h6>
  
  <p>Anyway, I'll tell you a story! One upon a time Fluttershy was at her house with her animals and she was very happy and
     she was eating oatmeal and then discord came and he didn't like oatmeal so he asked her why she was eating oatmeal and
     she said that she WAS made of oatmeal! So I was like WHA and she was like WOAH and we were all being turned into dinasaur-</p>
    
    
 <!-- Ummm... I'm invisible, just forget about me. --> 
 
  <p>Wait. Are you trying to tell me that I SHOULDN'T tell you my entire novel on why oatmeal is the worst food?! Well that's not good!
   Oh No! You're turning into an orange! RUN! AHHHHHHHHH! Wait, you say you've always been orange?!!! Wha- ohhhhh, 
    I totally forgot... Thanks for telling me! 
    
    Wait, you're not orange?! Than why did you say you were!? What?! You say there are multiple ponies reading this?! 
    And-and there all different colors?! How?!</p>
